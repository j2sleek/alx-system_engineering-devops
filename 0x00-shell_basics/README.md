# Introduction
Alx software engineering project to master shell basics. Below are the tasks and solutions.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line (why?)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
- You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
- All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, weâ€™ll learn more about how to utilize this command.

### 6. Welcome
Create a script that creates a directory named ***my_first_directory*** in the ***/tnp/*** directory. [6-firstdirectory](./6-firstdirectory)

### 7. Betty in my first directory
Move the file ***betty*** from ***/tmp/*** to ***/tmp/my_first_directory***. [7-movethatfile](./7-movethatfile)

### 8. Bye bye Betty
Delete the file ***betty***
- The file ***betty*** is in ***/tmp/my_first_directory***. [8-firstdelete](./8-firstdelete)

### 9. Bye bye My first directory
Delete the directory ***my_first_directory*** that is in the ***/tmp*** directory. [9-firstdirdeletion](./9-firstdirdeletion)

### 10. Back to the future
Write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one. [10-back](./10-back)

### 11. Lists

### 15. Let's move

- The listing should be alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which should be listed at the very beginning
- Only digits and letters are used to sort; Digits should come first
- You can assume that all the files we will test with will have at least one letter or one digit

### 19. File type: School
